However, this increase was judged to be based upon the rather low solvent controls. compared to the corresponding negative control, the threshold was not reached. the historical range of negative and solvent controls was only exceeded in the first culture of the second experiment at 87.5 and 175 μg/mL with metabolic activation. although this increase exceeded the historical range of solvent controls, it was not concentration-related and no comparable effect occurred in the parallel culture under identical conditions or in the first experiment. therefore, all these isolated positive effects were judged as not biologically relevant.
